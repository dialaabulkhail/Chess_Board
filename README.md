# Chess_Board
Render out chess boards with red and blue queens on them.

Chess board is an 8 by 8 grid of alternating black and white squares. The queens are red and blue squares.

Each board will have one red and one blue queen at different coordinates. In addition to displaying the board you’ll need to identify if the queens are “under attack” based on their coordinates.
